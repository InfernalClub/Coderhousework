            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Druids"> The Mystery of the druids</a>

        </nav> 
        The story takes place in Britain, where Detective Brent Halligan,<br> an inspector at Scotland Yard, investigates a brutal<br> series of murders committed in England.<br> The investigation leads Detective Halligan<br> into a mystery surrounding the demise of the British Order of Druids and eventually takes him on a trip through time itself.

        <h1>The Dynamics of an Asteroid</h1>
        <p>My objective with the course is to be able to create a page that, in the future, allows me to act as an open display of my projects </p>
        <p>while similar forms like blogs have existed for years, much of the current interesting projects that I have found like AI have made their <br> own pages to display their applications plus it would be fun to learn how to.</p>
        <p>However as it current stands I have no real dirrection for how I'll do it, so I'll leave this with some history about a certain game.</p>
    </main>

    <h1>Partially determined use page</h1>
        <p>My plan so far is to have a rotating display, basically a banner here</p>
        <p>Acess to a quick link to twitter on the block</p>
        <p>Eventually in the bottom add another quick access banner for different choices, should I choose to <br>
        follow up the original plan, I still have to give it some thought
        </p>
        <p>Gonna be messing more with it once I finish my current college obligations but I guess this is a good enough start.</p>

    <h2> Multiple testing to see which limitations of HTML</h2>
        <p>The initial part of my text was a joke based on the game of the mistery of the druids, in</p>
        <p>order to test the "br" function, which so far it seems successfull in its application</p>
        <p>I expect to make some mistakes in my writting too but that can be fixed</p>
        <p>Finally as of this week I'm done with the UI course, so I can focus 100% on this one.</p>
        <p>I have purposely writted "h3" out of order to see it's effects.<br>Which what it does is to reduce the size of the headers.</p>
        <p>Finally I'll leave with a section talking about the Mistery of the druids</p>
