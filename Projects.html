                Unity has been selected as my engine of choice to work on 3 different projects, as a team our journey has always been to make small projects in order to gain experience, simple mechanics with no lore or implications in between since it's more of a learning experience for the time beign.

It's widely recognised as the first form of references when doing games of this style, as the games not only have a distinc style, they are accompanied with excelent arrangements of songs dedicated to every stage. Mechanics are explored and changed in a game by game basics. An ispiring tale given that the game is done by a one man team, Zun himself is the artist, Music composer and Programer of the whole series which spans over 20 years.
